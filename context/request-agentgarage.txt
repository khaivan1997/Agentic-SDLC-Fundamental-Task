AgentGarage Training Exercise: LLM 
Workflow with N8N 
 
🎯 Objective 
In this exercise, you'll set up and explore AgentGarage – a lightweight GenAI development 
environment based on Docker, featuring: 
• A local LLM (connected via OpenWebUI or direct API) 
• N8N for workflow orchestration 
• A simple workspace for experimenting with SDLC-related automations 
The goal: build a simple use case from the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) domain, 
where N8N interacts with the local LLM.  
 
🧰 Tech Stack 
• Local LLM (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio, Mistral, etc.) 
• OpenWebUI (or direct LLM API access) 
• N8N (workflow automation) 
• Docker Compose (for local setup) 
 
🧪 Exercise Task 
1. Clone and start the AgentGarage environment using docker-compose. 
2. Access N8N and the local LLM via browser and verify the setup. 
3. Build a simple N8N workflow that communicates with the LLM API.  
4. Choose your own small use case within the SDLC context. 
 
✅ Requirements 
• The N8N workflow must include at least one API request to the local LLM. 
• The input/output flow must be traceable (e.g., via Webhook, File Input, Email, etc.). 
• You are responsible for prompt design (i.e., how N8N "talks" to the LLM). 
• Keep it simple, focused, and creative.

💡 Example Use Cases (for inspiration only)  
1. Pull Request Description Generator 
A workflow takes a commit message or changelog fragment, sends it to the LLM, and receives 
a clean, human-friendly pull request description. 
 
2. Code Review Suggestions 
A workflow receives a code snippet or diff from a pull request and uses the LLM to generate 
review comments or a code quality summary. 
Example output: 
“Looks good overall. Consider simplifying the nested loop in line 14. No test coverage found 
for the new function.” 
 
3. User Story to Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format) 
The workflow accepts a user story (in plain text), passes it to the LLM, and receives a 
structured list of acceptance criteria. 
Input: 
"As a user, I want to change my password so I can secure my account." 
Output: 
gherkin 
Given the user is logged in   
When the user navigates to the account settings and submits a new 
password   
Then the password should be updated and a confirmation message 
displayed   
 
🧠 Learning Goals 
• Get hands-on experience with Docker-based LLM environments 
• Understand API integration between N8N and a local language model 
• Apply prompt engineering to real SDLC workflows 
• Explore automation ideas within your daily development lifecycle
