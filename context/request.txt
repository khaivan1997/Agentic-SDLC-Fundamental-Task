Agentic SDLC Fundamental Task 
 
You must build a simple full-stack web application using the support of an agentic AI tool. The 
focus is on both the technical solution and the collaborative development process with the AI. 
 
📦 Project Description 
Project: "Task Manager" Web App 
Create a web application that allows users to manage tasks. The app should support basic CRUD 
operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.  
 
🔧 Tech Stack 
• Frontend: React.js (with TypeScript preferred), optional: Material UI or TailwindCSS 
• Backend: Spring Boot (Java 17+) 
• Database: In-Memory (H2) or PostgreSQL (optional) 
• Build Tools: 
o Frontend: Vite or Create React App 
o Backend: Maven or Gradle 
• Communication: REST API with JSON

💡 Detailed Requirements 
Entity: Task 
Task { 
  id: number (auto-generated) 
  title: string (required, max 100 characters) 
  description: string (optional, max 500 characters) 
  status: enum ["TODO", "IN_PROGRESS", "DONE"] 
  dueDate: date (optional) 
} 
 
🔁 Functional Requirements 
Frontend 
• A home page that lists all tasks. 
• A form to add a new task. 
• Options to edit and delete existing tasks. 
• Status should be changeable via dropdown. 
• Optional: Sort tasks by status or due date. 
• Form validations (e.g., required fields, character limits). 
• Display error messages on server/API failures. 
Backend 
• Expose a REST API with the following endpoints: 
o GET /api/tasks – Retrieve all tasks 
o GET /api/tasks/{id} – Retrieve a task by ID 
o POST /api/tasks – Create a new task 
o PUT /api/tasks/{id} – Update a task 
o DELETE /api/tasks/{id} – Delete a task 
• Validate input using Bean Validation (e.g., @NotBlank, @Size) 
• Store data in an H2 database (or PostgreSQL) 
• Enable CORS to allow frontend-backend communication

🤖 Agentic AI Involvement 
 
🧪 Development Approach 
1. Use the AI to help throughout the complete development phase:  
o Generating code 
o Debugging issues 
o Designing APIs 
o Refactoring 
o Prompting architecture decisions 
o Write Testcases 
o Document the project 
 
🚀 Bonus / Optional Features 
• Group tasks into categories 
• Add search/filter functionality 
• Deploy the frontend to Vercel or Netlify 
• Deploy the backend to Render, Fly.io or similar 
 
📅 Timeline & Deliverables 
• Duration: 1–2 working days 
• Deliverables: 
o Link to git repository 
 
✅ Success Criteria 
• The app runs successfully and supports all CRUD features. 
• The use of AI tools is clearly documented. 
• The code is structured and understandable. 
• Technical requirements are met. 
• AI usage is reflected upon critically and constructively.
