# Frontend Implementation Plan

## Overview
The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript, functioning as the user interface for the Task Manager.

## Technologies
- **Library**: React 18+
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI components
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for communicating with the Spring Boot backend API

## Core Features & UI Components

### 1. Dashboard View
- A central view that displays all existing tasks fetched from the backend.
- Tasks are visually separated into distinct sections or columns based on their current status: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" (fulfilling the 'group tasks into categories' bonus requirement).
- **Search & Filter**: Includes a search bar to filter tasks by title/description, fulfilling the optional search/filter requirement.
- **Sorting**: A dropdown allows sorting tasks by created order, status, or due date (fulfills optional requirement from request.txt).

### 2. Task Card (`TaskCard.tsx`)
- Displays individual task details: Title, Description, Status, and Due Date.
- Includes action buttons:
  - **Edit**: Opens the editing form for this task.
  - **Delete**: Prompts for confirmation and deletes the task.
  - **Status Dropdown**: Allows quickly moving a task between states (Todo -> In Progress -> Done).

### 3. Task Form (`TaskForm.tsx`)
- A unified form used for both **Creating** new tasks and **Editing** existing ones.
- **Fields**:
  - Title (Text input, Required)
  - Description (Textarea, Optional)
  - Status (Dropdown)
  - Due Date (Date picker, Optional)
- **Validation**:
  - Client-side validation to ensure the title is filled before submission.
  - Character limit enforcement (100 for title, 500 for description).
  - Loading states while saving to prevent double submissions.
  - **Error Display**: Displays server-side validation errors (e.g., field-level errors from Bean Validation) and generic API failure messages to the user.

### 4. API Integration (`api.ts`)
- A centralized Axios client with a configurable base URL (`VITE_API_BASE_URL` env variable, defaults to `/api/tasks` for WAR deployment).
- Handles response parsing and error catching.

## Styling Approach
- Clean, minimalist, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- Status indicators (e.g., colors or badges) to easily distinguish between task states.
- Hover effects and transitions for interactive elements to improve user experience.
