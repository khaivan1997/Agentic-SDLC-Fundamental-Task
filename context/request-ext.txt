Agentic SDLC Advanced 
Assignment:  
Build a Minimal Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for AI-Powered Data Injection. 
 
🎯 Objective 
Develop a MCP-compatible service in Spring Boot that allows an AI agent (e.g., Claude, GPT-4o, 
etc.) to interact with the database of an existing Task Management application — specifically to: 
• Understand the schema 
• Read from and insert into the database 
• Automatically generate and insert realistic test data 
The MCP service acts as a controlled access layer between the agent and the database.  
 
🧩 Architecture 
        [ AI Agent (e.g. Claude, GPT-4o) ] 
                      ⇅ 
        [ Custom MCP Server (Spring Boot) ] 
                      ⇅ 
        [ PostgreSQL DB (shared with Task Backend) ] 
Attention: The MCP server is not part of the main application flow and is used 
only by the agent to read/write data. 
 
📦 Project Scope 
Technologies 
• Spring Boot (Java 17+) 
• PostgreSQL 
• Spring Web + Spring Data JPA 
• Optional: JSON Schema Generator or Swagger/OpenAPI

🔧 Functional Requirements 
 
MCP Server Tools 
Tool Description 
mcp-schema-tasks Returns the database schema for the tasks table as a simplified JSON-
Schema 
mcp-tasks Accepts a JSON array of Task objects and inserts them into the DB 
mcp-tasks-
summary Returns summary statistics (e.g., task counts per status) 
mcp-help Returns a short, agent-readable description of available endpoints 
 
🧠 AI Agent Integration 
The AI agent should be able to: 
• Inspect the schema via mcp-schema-tasks 
• Generate 1000 realistic Task entries 
• Submit them to mcp-tasks 
• Validate success via mcp-tasks-summary or direct DB query 
 
✅ Success Criteria 
1. MCP Tool is running and accessible and respects specification version 2025-06-18i 
2. Schema inspection works via mcp-schema-tasks 
3. AI agent inserts 1000 task records via mcp-tasks 
4. Summary endpoint reflects the inserted data (e.g., shows 1000 tasks split across statuses) 
5. All actions are documented, including prompts, AI output, and results

📚 Deliverables 
• Git Repository with: 
o MCP Spring Boot source code 
o DB access setup (e.g., shared PostgreSQL connection config) 
• Documentation (README.md) including: 
o How the MCP server works 
o Sample prompts used with the agent 
o Result of the test: inserting 1000 records 
o Screenshot or log output showing inserted data count 
 
💬 Prompt Example for the Agent 
"Please inspect the task schema at /mcp/schema/tasks. Then generate and insert 1000 diverse 
tasks with random statuses, titles, and due dates using the /mcp/tasks endpoint." 
 
🧪 Optional Enhancements 
• OpenAPI documentation (/swagger -ui) 
• Auth token for AI interaction (if needed)  
• Logging or auditing of AI-originated actions
