# Code Review Criteria

This checklist is used during the code review phase to verify that the generated code meets the requirements of the Agentic SDLC Fundamental Task, keeping in mind the scope of a simple, full-stack application.

## 1. Functional Requirements Verification
- [ ] **Data Model:** The Task entity matches the required schema (`id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `dueDate`).
- [ ] **Backend API:** All 5 required REST endpoints (GET all, GET by ID, POST, PUT, DELETE) are implemented and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- [ ] **Frontend UI:** The React app successfully connects to the backend and can perform all CRUD operations.
- [ ] **Validation:** Title length (max 100) and existence are validated. Meaningful error messages are displayed in the UI when validation fails.
- [ ] **Bonus Features:** Task grouping (columns), Task sorting, and Task search/filter functionalities are implemented.

## 2. Architecture & Infrastructure
- [ ] **Database:** In-memory H2 database is used correctly.
- [ ] **CORS:** Frontend origins are allowed by the backend `/api/**` endpoints.
- [ ] **Maven Build:** The project uses a multi-module structure where the backend WAR naturally serves the bundled frontend static assets.

## 3. General Readability & Coding Style
- [ ] **Spring Boot:** Clear separation of concerns (Controller → Service → Repository).
- [ ] **React/TS:** Use of functional components, hooks, and explicit TypeScript interfaces instead of `any`.
- [ ] **API Service:** Frontend abstract API calls into a centralized service layer (e.g., `api.ts`).
- [ ] **Clean Code:** Code is free of unused imports, console.log statements, and magic numbers. Names are descriptive and consistent.
